### What is Peercoin (PPC)?
[Peercoin](http://peercoin.net/) (abbreviated PPC), is the first [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) design to pioneer a hybrid [proof-of-stake consensus](http://peercoin.net/bin/peercoin-paper.pdf)  [proof-of-stake](http://peercoin.net/bin/peercoin-paper.pdf)/[proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) minting system. Peercoin is based on [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/en/), and introduces many important innovations to cryptocurrency field including new security model, energy efficiency, better minting model and more adaptive response to rapid changes in network computation power.

Peercoin-CE exists to further develop and improve the the Wallet UX of Peercoin in order to foster and encourage wider adoption.

Repo Guidelines
================================

* Developers work in their own forks and then submit pull requests when they beleive their feature or bug fix is ready.  
* All new functions and changes to existing functions must be commented before a pull will be accepted.  The first mandatory Comment at the top of the function just beaneat its declaration should the purpose of the funtion.  The second mandatory comment the return should state what is returned and why/how that return might be used.
* Variable declaratiosn must be given self-descriptive names and not be easily mistaken for other variables.
* If a pull request only makes simple/trivial/non-controversial changes, then one of the development team members may simply pulls it.
* If it is a more complicated or potentially controversial change, then the change may be discussed in the pull request, or the requester may be asked to start a discussion [Peercoin Talk](http://www.peercointalk.org/) for a broader community discussion. 
* The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt) or are controversial.
* From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will be used to issue a warning of closure.  Pull requests closed in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.
